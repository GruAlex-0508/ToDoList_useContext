# ToDo List

A simple toDo list built with React. Add tasks, mark them complete, and remove
them from the list.

## Features

- Add tasks with the input field. Empty entries are ignored.
- Click a task to toggle its completed state.
- Remove a task with the × button.
- Starts with a few sample tasks so the list is populated on launch.

Tasks are stored in the app's in-memory state. They are not saved between page
reloads.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm

## Getting started

Install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page
reloads when you edit the source.
